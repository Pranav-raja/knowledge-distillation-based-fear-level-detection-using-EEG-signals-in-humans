# knowledge-distillation-based-fear-level-detection-using-EEG-signals-in-humans
Your fear level detection system uses knowledge distillation and DEAP dataset signals, leveraging models like CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers to classify real-time emotional states into four levels: normal, low, medium, and high fear. This approach supports applications in mental health, gaming, and adaptive systems.
